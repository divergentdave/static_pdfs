PDF files to use when testing pdfrw

These were found in various places on the internet,
and are individually copyright by whoever owns them.

I place no copyright on the collection.

The goal is to keep them here for regression testing,
and never remove any of them unless it is the subject
of a copyright complaint, in which case I will remove
it from the collection.
